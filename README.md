**PacStudent - Classic Game Recreation**

**Overview**

This project is part of 31263/32004 Introduction to Game Development - Assessment 3 at UTS. The goal was to recreate a classic Atari-era game, Pac-man, with original visual and audio assets, adhering to strict development constraints while following the core mechanics of the game. This submission focuses on visual asset creation, audio sourcing, manual level layout, and basic movement setup.

**Features Implemented (Assessment 3)**
Manual Level Layout: Recreated the original Pac-man Level 01 using custom sprites based on a 2D array.
 Original Visual Assets: Designed unique sprites for:
PacStudent
Ghosts in various states (normal, scared, dead)
Pellets, Power pellets, Walls, and Bonus items
Custom Audio: Sourced royalty-free audio clips for background music and key game events:
Movement sound
Pellet collection sound
PacStudent death sound
Basic PacStudent Movement: Implemented frame-rate independent movement logic for PacStudent to navigate the recreated level layout.

**Development Constraints**

The project was developed in 2D using Unity.
No use of Rigidbody or CharacterController components.
All visual assets were designed from scratch to avoid copyright infringement.

**Git Version Control:**
The project is managed with Git and includes:
Frequent commits at key milestones.
Branches for each major feature, including Feature-Audio, Feature-Visual, Feature-ManualLevel, and Feature-Movement.

**Branching Strategy**
The following branches were used in the development of this assessment:

Master: Contains the final submission-ready version of the project.
Development: Central development branch.
Feature-Audio: For adding audio assets and functionality.
Feature-Visual: For importing and animating custom sprites.
Feature-ManualLevel: For constructing the level layout manually.
Feature-Movement: For coding PacStudent's movement mechanics.

**Assets**
Visual Assets: Designed using Piskel.
Audio Assets: Sourced from royalty-free libraries like Bfxr.

**License**
This project is for educational purposes and follows the guidelines set by UTS. All visual assets and game scripts are my original work.
